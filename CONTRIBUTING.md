1. A file should contain only one module. It can have more than one primitives though.
3. Module name and file name have to be the same.
132. In module definitions, output ports have to be declared first, followed by inout ports and then input ports. Same goes with primitives too.
12. Use camelCase for names.
4. Please try to make the module as general as possible using parameters. (It's fine if it isn't though)
